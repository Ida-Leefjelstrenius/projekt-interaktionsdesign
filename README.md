Our project APP2U explores how multimodal interaction and sensor-based input can
enhance user experience in mobile games. The game is set in an underwater world where
users interact with entities such as sharks, mines and chests through gestures. The game
has two primary objectives: the first is to stay alive as long as possible, and the second
is to collect coins. Their longest survival time will be displayed as their high score on
the start page. The player will lose the game when the player gets eaten by the shark or
collides with one of the bombs. Both chests and mines will spawn randomly throughout
the game.  

The core idea was roughly etched out at the initial workshop held in the course and
iteratively refined through a variety of brainstorming exercises. We were particularly in-
terested in exploring interaction beyond touch and making use of accelerometers to expand
what a mobile game could respond to. We felt that the repetitive clicking interaction of
many mobile games was not immersive enough for what we were trying to create. Other
sensors were also of interest and we explored if they could be implemented in a playful
way. An example would be using the light sensor to change the appearance of the game.
Our teamâ€™s shared interest in mobile games made the development process smooth and
enjoyable as we often found agreement in many of the design choices.
